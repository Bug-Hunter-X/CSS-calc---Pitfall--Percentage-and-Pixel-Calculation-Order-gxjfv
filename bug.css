The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a common pitfall when dealing with percentage values alongside other units (like pixels).  For instance, if you have `width: calc(50% - 10px);`, this calculates 50% of the *containing element's width* and *then* subtracts 10 pixels. This might not always produce the expected results, especially if the containing element's width isn't known or is dynamic.  The subtraction occurs after the percentage calculation, not proportionally.
